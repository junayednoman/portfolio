              At the end of 2021, I began my journey with HTML and CSS,
              expanding into Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL(basic). I freelanced with these
              skills until June 2023. During the freelance period, I have worked
              with raw HTML and CSS. Then I started learning JavaScript-based
              front-end and basic back-end development in July 2023.

              Afterward, I collaborated on some contractual projects. In
              particular, I got an opportunity to develop a â€˜data collection
              systemâ€™ for around 200 primary schools that won first place in a
              divisional competition of the primary education department. That
              significantly enhanced my skills. These projects were a
              blessing for me. I have learned such knowledge that I couldnâ€™t
              learn without working on such real-world projects.

              Currently, I am learning new technologies to become a proficient
              MERN stack developer.
